# Swarm 2025 Frontend 
To run development server, use `npm run dev`. There is no build script yet.


# Code of Conduct
1. Even though it is not mandatory in ESLint standards, placing a semicolon at
the end of lines is recommended for future-proof code, as potential syntax 
updates may break the code by changing statement and expression rules.
2. The limit on the length of lines is 80 columns and this is a strongly
preferred limit.
3. Indentations are 4 characters. There are heretic movements that try to make 
2 characters deep, and that is akin to trying to define the value of PI to 
be 3.
